# DJI Tello Drone Programs

Four fun Python programs for flying your DJI Tello drone with live video!

## Programs

### 1. Square Flight Demo (`square_flight.py`)
Watch your drone fly in a perfect square pattern while seeing live video with on-screen instructions. Great for demonstrations and learning!

**Features:**
- Autonomous square flight pattern
- Live video feed with status overlay
- On-screen step-by-step instructions
- Battery level monitoring
- Safe landing on completion

### 2. Remote Control (`remote_control.py`)
Fly your Tello drone using your keyboard with live video feedback!

**Controls:**
- `W/A/S/D` - Move forward/left/back/right
- `I/P` - Move up/down
- `Q/E` - Rotate left/right
- `T` - Take off
- `L` - Land
- `ESC` - Emergency land and quit

**Features:**
- Real-time keyboard control
- Live video with control overlay
- Battery monitoring
- Flight status display
- Emergency landing capability

### 3. Remote Control with Facial Recognition (`remote_control_facial_recognition.py`)
Fly your drone with keyboard controls while the AI automatically detects and highlights faces in the video feed!

**Controls:** (same as Remote Control, plus:)
- `F` - Toggle face detection on/off

**Features:**
- All features from Remote Control program
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascades
- Green bounding boxes around detected faces
- Face counter showing number of faces detected
- Lightweight ML model optimized for real-time performance
- Toggle detection on/off during flight
- FPS (frames per second) display

**Perfect for:**
- Learning about computer vision and AI
- Following people or pets safely
- Search and rescue demonstrations
- Understanding how drones can "see"

### 4. Controller/Joystick Remote Control (`remote_control_joystick.py`)
Fly your drone with a game controller for the most natural flying experience!

**Supported Controllers:**
- PlayStation 4 (PS4) DualShock
- Xbox One controller
- Generic USB game controllers

**Controls:**
- **Left Stick Y** - Throttle (up/down)
- **Left Stick X** - Yaw (rotate)
- **Right Stick Y** - Pitch (forward/backward)
- **Right Stick X** - Roll (left/right)
- **Triangle/Y** - Take off
- **Cross/A** - Land
- **Circle/B** - Toggle face detection
- **L1/LB** - Emergency stop

**Features:**
- Smooth analog control with automatic deadzone
- Auto-detects controller type (PS4/Xbox/Generic)
- Dual view: Color + Edge detection
- Real-time telemetry (roll, pitch, yaw, throttle)
- Optional face detection
- FPS display
- Continuous movement based on stick position

**Perfect for:**
- The most intuitive drone control experience
- Smooth, precise movements
- Gamers who want to fly like a video game
- Advanced flight maneuvers

## Requirements

- DJI Tello or Tello EDU drone
- Python 3.8+
- uv (Python package manager)
- just (command runner) - optional but recommended

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

Make sure your Tello drone is:
- Fully charged (at least 50% battery recommended)
- Powered on
- Connected to your computer via WiFi

The Tello creates its own WiFi network called `TELLO-XXXXXX`. Connect to it before running the programs.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install with uv
uv sync

# Or if you prefer pip
pip install djitellopy opencv-python pillow
```

### 3. Run Programs

**Using just (recommended):**
```bash
# Square flight demo
just square

# Remote control
just remote

# Remote control with face detection
just faces

# Controller/joystick control
just controller

# Test connection
just test-connection

# Check battery
just battery
```

**Or run directly:**
```bash
# Square flight demo
uv run python square_flight.py

# Remote control
uv run python remote_control.py

# Remote control with facial recognition
uv run python remote_control_facial_recognition.py

# Controller/joystick control
uv run python remote_control_joystick.py
```

## Safety Tips

- Always fly in an open area with at least 2m clearance on all sides
- Keep the drone in your line of sight
- Don't fly near people, animals, or fragile objects
- Check battery level before flying (should be >20%)
- Have a clear flight path with no obstacles
- Be ready to use emergency landing (ESC key) if needed
- Don't fly outdoors in windy conditions (Tello is a small drone)

## Troubleshooting

**Video not showing?**
- Make sure you're connected to the Tello's WiFi network
- Try updating the Tello firmware via the official Tello app
- Wait a few seconds after starting - video stream needs time to initialize

**Drone not responding?**
- Check WiFi connection to `TELLO-XXXXXX`
- Restart the drone
- Make sure battery is charged (>10%)
- Try the connection test: `just test-connection`

**Controls not working in remote control mode?**
- Make sure the video window is selected (click on it)
- Check that the drone has taken off first (press `T`)
- Verify you're pressing the correct keys

**Drone won't take off?**
- Check battery level (must be >10%, recommended >20%)
- Make sure the drone is on a flat surface
- Check that propellers are properly attached
- Restart the drone and try again

## Educational Use

These programs are designed for kids ages 10-15 to learn about:
- Drone programming
- Computer vision and AI (live video and face detection)
- Machine learning in action (facial recognition)
- Coordinate systems and geometry (square pattern)
- User input handling (keyboard controls)
- Safety and responsible flying
- Real-world applications of robotics and AI
